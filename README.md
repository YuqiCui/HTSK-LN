# HTSK-LN-ReLU
This is the code for paper "Layer Normalization for TSK Fuzzy System Optimization in Regression Problems"


# Open source package PyTSK
We now offer an open source Python package that implements this article's HTSK-ln-Relu algorithm as well as other fuzzy system algorithms. 
This package can be found at https://pytskdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
